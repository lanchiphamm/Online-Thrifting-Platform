# Online Thrifting Platform

## About 
### Purpose
**Online Thrift Store** is a platform where users can buy, sell, and browse secondhand clothes. 
Sellers can post their pre-owned goods with their price and description, while buyers can directly 
purchase or get connected to the owners of the pieces they are interested in for more information.

Online Thrift Store is targeted towards those who want to find new owners for the goods they are no 
longer interested in either through selling or donating, and those who want to purchase high-quality
unique pieces or try a new style while saving money. In addition, thrifting contributes
to helping the environment as it is a recycling process of labour and materials. It also helps 
preserve natural resources.

### Motivation
The idea stems from my own need I have outfits that I have worn only once or twice as they do not 
fit my style, and I would love to find new owners who can work these pieces in a fashionable way. 
Likewise, every so often I find it hard to buy low cost stylish or branded apparels unless I spend 
a lot of time browsing different sites or visiting physical stores. Although that is the fun of 
thrifting - putting time into finding the perfect vintage piece of clothing, I would at times opt 
for an easier and more time-saving route. The main idea behind this is to create a social media liked 
platform solely for the purpose of selling and buying used clothes where users can send message to 
each other as well
